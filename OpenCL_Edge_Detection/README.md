# Edge Detection
Detect edges in an image, considering upper and lower brightness thresholds. The algorithm determines whether a pixel should be set to white or black in order to highlight or suppress certain features within the image. This approach offers fine-grained control over the appearance of the output, allowing the preservation of specific details while discarding others based on brightness characteristics.
